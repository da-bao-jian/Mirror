# The Mirror

Mirror is a creative coding project experimenting with the Tensorflow.js package.

![Demo](https://github.com/dabaojian1992/Mirror/blob/main/2021-02-22%2016.40.44.gif)

### Technology Used ###

-Vanilla Javascript

-Tensorflowjs

-P5

### To start ###

* Head over to the [Live](https://dabaojian1992.github.io/Mirror/) site;

* Upon granting access to the microphone and webcam, say "START" (this could take couple seconds);

* Once the voice input turns into floating text on the screen, the webcam will initiate facial scan;

* Try switching between the masks either using the buttons on the bottom or saying the name of the mask;

* Everything you say will be translated into floating text on the screen

* Have fun!
