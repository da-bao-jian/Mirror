# Mirror

Mirror is a real time human-computer interaction app where computer will capture the user's facial structure and generat art effect.

Technology Used

-Tensorflowjs

-P5/Threejs/D3/pts (TBD)

-Vanilla Javascript


MVP

-Computer is able to detect user's facial structure 
-real-time effect rendering per user's selection
